# Jamdown Fusion

This website is created for a client setting up their homemade food business. The brief was to to create a landing page that would:
-  Display a user-uploaded menu, which would change every week, 
- Some promotional material 
- How to order details 
- An about me section
- List of allergens

## Technology

- React to create a static single page application. 
- Contentful CMS to store user uploaded content and REST API to receive it. 
- Firebase to host the site.  

## Challenges

I had not worked with a CMS before and had limited knowledge of hosting websites. The coding side of things caused no problems whatsoever but the non-code elements of the site required a bit of a learning curve. That being said, Once all the account were set up, Firebase and Contentful are actually very easy to use. I've not had a real-world scenario in which I've had to use a restful API so using the one from Contentful was actually quite fun.
