          <p>
            Elaine decided during the Covid lockdown that there is more to life
            than paying a huge mortgage and commuting into the City to work as a
            lawyer. She downsized, moved to Swindon (her childhood home) and
            decided to start a business selling freshly made, cooked Caribbean
            from home. Caribbean food is Elaine's passion. She wants her food to
            taste like "the real deal". Elaine was born in Jamaica and came to
            Swindon with her parents when she was 5 years old. Jamaica is in her
            blood and she thinks Jamaican food is some of the most flavoursome
            food around. Having spent many years feeding her many friends from
            London and Luton, Elaine now wants to branch out and feed Swindon!
            She believes in quality food at affordable prices.
